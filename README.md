## 🙋 About the Project

StellarSnap was created to combine my interest in frontend development with a personal love for space and astronomy. It was also an opportunity to:

- Practice component-based architecture in React
- Learn API integration and secure environment variable handling
- Build a fully deployed and mobile-ready portfolio project
